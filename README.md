# ICY Bot

A stack of services and APIs that is designed to work together as an application providing comfortability for ISE student amidst an intense, as well as competitive, studying environment.

## Technology stack

In the current release, we have built a bot that implement Dialogflow and LINE Messaging API to provide study solution for students. We also use containerisation and CI/CD pipelines as a pathway to robust deployment on DigitalOcean Kubernetes as well.

## Contribution

Since this project has a sole purpose on improving studying environment for ISE students, we are happy to let anyone who are interested to contribute to the project. The contact channel will be announced soon.

## CI/CD

At this stage, we have not develop the CI yet because our application is still small and manageable. On the other hand, we have implemented a simple CD pipelines for building and pushing Docker image to Docker Hub. That being said, the container registry name is `sprawlers/icy`.
